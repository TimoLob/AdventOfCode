Proccess : Process Pulses in an EventQueue. For each pulse, add one "update" event to the front of the queue and one "real" pulse to the end of the queue.
The update event simply updates the Conjunction modules without sending any new pulses.

Pulses are counted as they are added to the event queue.
Code passes for both example inputs but fails for the real input.
