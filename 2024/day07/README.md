# Day 7

Part 1 : Go backwards through the numbers of an equation, only recursively test numbers if the rest is divisible by the last number or subtracting the last number leaves a rest bigger rest than 0.

Part 2 : Going backwards is no longer that easy. Go forwards through the equations and try each operator. Early stop as soon as the current result gets bigger than the target.
